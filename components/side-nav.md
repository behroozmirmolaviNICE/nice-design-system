## What problem does this solve?

When you need navigation to support deeper content or guidance chapters.

## When and how to use?

- to display a secondary navigational hierarchy 
- when you need our users to navigate through subpages or content chapters
- always position to the far left of the interface to maintain consistency
- try to keep navigational links short
- always use an active link to display what page the user is on
- if your hierarchy is over three level, look in to simplifying your navigation
