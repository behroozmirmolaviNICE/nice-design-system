Their primary usage is as a navigational element. They can also be used as a replacement for a button in space constrained situations (tables, forms, panels) or  when you need less visual prominence to perform an action.

## Wording

The wording of links is very important and should be contextual and meaningful. Link text should tell the user where they are going. DO NOT write ‘click here’ as a link! ‘Read more’ and other such phrases are also bad practice. Screen readers read out links as a list, so link text needs to be descriptive. Avoid making links too long.

- provides some information when read out of context
- explains what the link offers
- doesn't talk about mechanics
- is not a verb phrase

## Text links

- links within body copy should be blue and underlined
- links without surrounding text should not have a full stop at the end

## Heading links

The default styling is blue and underlined, to indicate that it’s a clickable link, but 
depending on the context in that the heading link appears, some of these rules could be relaxed. Check that your users understand this.

## Download links

- it’s good practice to tell the user if they are downloading a media file
